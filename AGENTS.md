# AGENTS.md for sample1

## Plan File Rule
- For this repository, whenever `<proposed_plan>` is finalized, save the same content to `plan.md` in repository root.
- Default mode is overwrite.
- Default path is `plan.md` at repo root unless user requests another path.

## Fallback
- If file mutation is not allowed in the current mode, output the plan only and state that file save will run after mode switch.
